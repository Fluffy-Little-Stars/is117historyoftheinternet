    <h1> Dot Com Bubble</h1>
    <p>We have encountered multiple amazing companies throughout the years. But on the internet, we have seen modern and innovative websites. One of these is Amazon by Jeff Bezos. Which started in a garage in 1995. Another one of the most successful websites was created by Pierre Omidyar in 1995 which we know now as Ebay.
    </p>
        <p>Both Amazon and Ebay were launched around the same time and were successful in a couple of months.
</p>
<p>It took only 4 years for 50 million people to use the internet, and as the number of users has increased, the network has become more and more useful and more popular. For sites like Amazon, as the web became more popular, numbers started to demonstrate that the site was, without a doubt, a good investment. Wall Street soon noticed the exponential growth of Amazon as investors noticed the potential of this ‘library’. Amazon’s users were enchanted by the website since Bezzos lowered the prices whenever he had the opportunity in order to boost the popularity of the website.
</p>
<p>
    But how do we make business on the internet without the risk of confidential information being stolen? Three mathematicians, Martin Hellman, Whitfield Diffie and Ralph Merkle, developed Public key cryptography. This allows the sender to send confidential information and only allow the business to have the key for this information. Once this was set, investors were even more interested in Amazon and Ebay. Ebay opened stocks and they soared on the first day, making it become a  multi billion company in very little time.  Amazon’s value also doubled within a few weeks even though the company was not doing so well financially.
</p>
<p>
    Investors and Americans were putting their money on multiple websites with stock shares, not only Amazon and Ebay. Buying stocks became popular all over the world. TV ad campaigns were also a popular investment. Investment on e commerce was thriving.
</p>
<p>
    However, there was a collapse in the stock market, historically known as blackfriday, after much of the investments in e-commerce came to a low because of an unexpected performance of selling websites during the holidays. Fortunately, Amazon and ebay succeeded through the crash of the stock market because they understood the power of the customer. Both were businesses whose goal was to satisfy the customers instead of just wanting to make a profit.
