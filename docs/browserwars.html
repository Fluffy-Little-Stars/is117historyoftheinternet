        <h1>Browser Wars</h1>
        <p>
            Back in 1993, a group of computer students from the University of Illinois were fascinated by the invention of the web, which had just happened a couple of years earlier. During this decade, webpages were completely different from what we know today. These platforms were not interactive and consisted mainly of paragraphs or just information. But the development of the web had intrigued various computer science students at the university, one of them being Marc Andreessen. Andreessen soon started creating programs with the goal in mind that everyone could use websites.
        </p>
        <p>
            Jim Clark, a powerful and wealthy businessman recruited Andreessen once this young creator graduated from college. The duo had a plan of developing a computer company; Mosaic. Clark and Andreessen wanted their innovative company to spread as much as other giant tech companies, Microsoft being one of them. However, Bill Gates, co founder and CEO of Microsoft, had trouble seeing the opportunity of developing web interactions like the ones Mosaic had in mind. He created his own Microsoft network, and planned to hold full power over the use of the web. Gates had just started to grow a monopoly; almost all of the PCs were running on Microsoft networks, and he had no intent to make less money.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mosaic eventually became ‘Netscape’. But the goals of the company were still the same. However, as Netscape became more popular they soon realized that Microsoft was a harsh competitor. Gates too realized the importance of the web since he saw the popularity that Netscape was accumulating. Both companies regarded each other as competitors and implicitly started a war between each other.
        </p>
        <p>
            Netscape was growing exponentially, and Microsoft was starting to get concerned. Gates decided to make an offer so that the two companies could work together, but he also decided to offer to buy Netscape. Netscape saw this offer as an opportunity to put a demand for the illegal offer since this was a behavior against monopoly policies in the United States. But, on another suspicious end was Netscape, which had previously hired lawyers prepared to fight any illegal actions by Microsoft.
        </p>
        <p>
            Netscape continued to grow rapidly and soon became the giant. Meanwhile, Microsoft created internet explorer as a means to destroy Netscape. They put out several updates of internet explorer and also made sure to copy and better any move that  Netscape made. Engineers from both companies worked around the clock with one only motivator in mind: destroy each other.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, Microsoft made a smart move that would without doubt win the support of millions of people; internet explorer became free to use. There was nothing Netscape could do to beat Microsoft at that point. Microsoft and its engineers celebrated as they crashed a van against Netscape’s headquarters and with that, officially declared themselves winners of the Browser Wars. Although it was a victory against Netscape, Microsoft soon faced another giant; the United States government, which had also started a war against Microsoft’s monopoly. And even though the government found proof of Gates stating that he wanted to destroy or buy Netscape, Microsoft came out victorious once again as the judge decided that punishing the company was not fitting to the crime.
