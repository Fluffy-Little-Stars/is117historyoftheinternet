    <h1>Internet Search</h1>
<p>
    When you open your browser and look for a website or start to do some research for a topic the first thing people usually do is head over to google, or more specifically https://www.google.com, but before 1994 you would have to remember the link to a site or you would have to go on a scavenger hut and surf the web to find the site you were looking for though link redirects. That all changed once Stanford students, Jerry Yang and David Filo, developed the search engine some of us know today as Yahoo.
</p>
<p>
    Yahoo, funny enough, was developed while Yang and Filo’s professor went on a year-long sabbatical. While Yang and Filo were successfully developing their software they ran into an issue that many startups face, lack of funds. In Silicon Valley, start-ups are surrounded by an ocean of venture capitalists and Michael Moritz, a venture capitalist at Sequoia Capital, went to visit Yang and Filo’s Trailer at Stanford when he heard about their software. While the company grew in size, they still struggled with the need for developing funds, so Moritz offered the idea of having ads on their search engine. But Yang and Filo were afraid that if they posted ads on Yahoo people would stop using their website. Luckily posting ads did the exact opposite for the company and even started a boom in interest from venture capitalists for startups related to the internet.
</p>
<p>
    With the increase in interest comes an increase in rivals, and Yahoo’s success did just so. In 1996 a new search engine popped up into the market by the name of Excite and in a matter of months Excite caught up to Yahoo in their number of features. Which led to a game of digital tennis between the two companies, when one company released a feature on their site the opposite company would develop the same feature too and this kept going on for a while.
</p>
<p>
    With the two companies stuck in their endless game of tennis, another company was able to grow under their nose. We now all know this company as Alphabet Inc. or more well known, Google, unlike Yahoo and Excite Google offered a different way of searching for sites. They organized their pages based on the amount of views a site got and so this led to better search results since people would find what they needed more easily. But Google also faced the same difficulties as Yahoo and was struggling with their financials, so it was offered for Excite to take hold of the company for $1 million dollars. However, Excite decided to turn down the offer. Google is now worth over $100 billion dollars.
</p>
<p>
    With the denial of Excite absorbing Google, the creators of the website had to find someone to help them get their feet off the ground, so they went to Andy Bechtolsheim. Google showed Bechtolsheim their product, and he really liked what he saw, so he wrote them a check for $100k on the spot to help them get off the ground. For the average person $100k is a lot of money, but in the valley $100k is chump change, so Brin and Page had to find another source of financial income to help keep their company afloat. This is when venture capitalists John Doerr, the wealthiest venture capitalist in the valley, came into the spotlight of Google's fame. A meeting was set up between Brin, Page, and Doerr. Instead of Brin and Page asking Doerr for money they told him, “We will bring you $10 billion dollars in revenu.” Doerr thought it was funny because of how naive the two were. He had a good feeling about them and ended up writing them a check for $12 Million dollars. It was a good thing he did because he got his promised cut of the $10 billion dollars.
</p>
<p>
    While Google was still developing their product they still had to figure out how to make a revenue by not relying solely on one individual, so they had to discuss the inevitable as their predecessors had to discuss banner ads. Google was against the idea of banner ads and wanted the concept to have nothing to do with their product, so they had to come up with an innovative way of advertising. They ended up developing a system where a company would pay google to have their website come up to the top of someone's search result. It was later found out that Brin and Page stole this idea from a company run by Bill Gross. Google ended up having to go to court over the matter, but was resolved with Google having to pay Gross for the idea.
</p>
<p>
    On August 19th, 2004 Google decided to make their shared public and their starting price was $85, which was unheard of, but ever since then their shares have never gone down their starting price. The company is still growing till today and has made many apps that a lot of us use today, like Google Docs, Sheet, Maps, Calendar, and they absorbed companies like YouTube, Picasso (which got turned into Google Photos), and Blogger (which got turned into Google Sites).
